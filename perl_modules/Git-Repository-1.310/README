Git-Repository

Git::Repository is a Perl interface to Git, allowing scripted
interactions with one or more repositories. It's a low-level interface,
allowing to call any Git command, either porcelain or plumbing,
including bidirectional commands such as git commit-tree.

Since it is a low-level interface, it doesn't provide any fancy way to
call Git commands. It is up to the programmer to setup any environment
variables (except GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE) that the underlying
Git command may need and use.
